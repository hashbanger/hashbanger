### Hello.

My name is Prashant. I am an Engineer currently working as a **_Data Scientist_**.

In my professional life I deal with problems in the domain of **_Machine Learning_**, such as image processing, natural language processing and data analysis & vizualisation.
I am _less-mathematician-more-programmer_ data scientist who self learned the domain through online sources and trying to catch up with all the mathematical aspects of the practical knowledge that I apply everyday as much as I could.
