### Hello.

My name is Prashant. I am an Engineer currently working as a **_Data Scientist_**.

In my professional life, I work on problems in the domain of Machine Learning, including image processing, natural language processing, data analysis and visualization, and increasingly, Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).

I consider myself a "less-mathematician, more-programmer" data scientist â€” a self-learner who entered the field through hands-on experience and practical problem-solving. While I apply machine learning techniques daily, I continue to strengthen my understanding of the underlying mathematics to bridge the gap between theory and practice.
